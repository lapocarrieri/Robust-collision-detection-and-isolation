# Robust-collision-detection-and-isolation
This project proposes an innovative approach for calculating residuals in a robotic  arm, eliminating the need for costly sensors. In contrast to the traditional mo- mentum residual-based calculation method, our approach leverages a Sliding Mode  Momentum Observer (SMO) to achieve superior performance.
